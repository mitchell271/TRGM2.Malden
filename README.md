# TRGM2.Malden
Fork of TRGM2.Malden, adding option for base types

End goal is to have 2 bases possible:
- land base
- carrier base

Since TRGM2 can be used across compatible maps, it makes more sense from a milsim perspective to have a mobile base, rather than setting everything up again on each island.
